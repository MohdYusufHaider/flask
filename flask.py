#Q1> What is a Web API?
#ANs
#A Web API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other over the web. It enables access to data or functionality, typically via HTTP requests, allowing developers to integrate different systems or services.

#Q2>How does a Web API differ from a web service?
#Ans>>
#Web API: Refers to any interface that can be accessed over the internet, often using HTTP/HTTPS.
#Web Service: A more specific type of Web API that strictly follows standards like SOAP or REST and is designed for interoperable machine-to-machine communication
#Q3>What are the benefits of using Web APIs in software development?
#Ans>.
#Interperability
#Scalibility
#Resuasibility
#Effiecinecy


#Q4 Explain the difference between SOAP and RESTful APIs?
#Ans>.
#SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):
#Uses XML for messaging.
#Strict standards and built-in error handling.
#Stateful or stateless.
#Protocol-based (HTTP, SMTP).
#REST (Representational State Transfer):
#Lightweight, relies on HTTP methods.
#Can use JSON, XML, or other formats.
#Stateless and resource-oriented.
#Simpler and faster compared to SOAP


#Q5> What is JSON and how is it commonly used in Web APIs?
#Ans>.
#JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and for machines to parse.
#Common Uses: Data exchange between clients and servers, particularly in RESTful APIs.


#Q6>Can you name some popular Web API protocols other than REST?

#ANs>.
#SOAP,GraphQL,WebSockets


#Q7> What role do HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) play in Web API development?
#ANs>.
#GET: Retrieve data.
#POST: Create new data.
#PUT: Update existing data.
#DELETE: Remove data.
#PATCH: Partially update data.


#Q8>What is the purpose of authentication and authorization in Web APIs?
#Ans>.
#Authentication: Verifies the identity of the user (e.g., API keys, OAuth).
#Authorization: Determines what the authenticated user can access.


#Q9>How can you handle versioning in Web API development?
#Ans>.
#URL Versioning: /v1/resource
#Header Versioning: Custom headers like Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json
#Query Parameters: 



#Q10>What are the main components of an HTTP request and response in the context of Web APIs?
#Ans>.
#Request Components:
#Method (GET, POST, etc.)
#URL/URI
#Headers (metadata)
#Body (optional, for POST/PUT)
#Response Components:
#Status Code (200 OK, 404 Not Found)
#Headers
#Body (payload)


#Q11>Describe the concept of rate limiting in the context of Web APIs?
#Ans>.
#Controls how many requests a client can make within a specific timeframe to prevent abuse or overloading.


#Q12> How can you handle errors and exceptions in Web API responses?
#Ans>.
#Return standardized error codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error).
#Provide error messages and details in the response body.



#Q13>Explain the concept of statelessness in RESTful Web APIs?
#Ans>.
#Each request contains all necessary information, and the server does not store client state between requests. This improves scalability.





#Q14>What are the best practices for designing and documenting Web APIs?
#Ans>.
#Use meaningful endpoints and verbs.
#Follow consistent naming conventions.
#Implement error handling and status codes.
#Document with OpenAPI (Swagger).
#Secure with authentication.

#Q15> What role do API keys and tokens play in securing Web APIs?
#Ans>.
#API Keys: Simple tokens to identify the client.
#Tokens (OAuth): More secure, often with expiry and scopes for authorization.


#Q16> What is REST, and what are its key principles?
#Ans>.
# Statelessness
#Client-server architecture
#Uniform interface
#Resource-based URLs
#Use of HTTP methods


#Q17> Explain the difference between RESTful APIs and traditional web services?
#Ans>.
#RESTful APIs: Lightweight, stateless, uses HTTP.
#Traditional Web Services (SOAP): Heavier, more rigid, uses XML


#Q18>What are the main HTTP methods used in RESTful architecture, and what are their purposes?
#Ans>.
#GET: Retrieve data.
#POST: Create data.
#PUT: Update data.
#DELETE: Remove data.
#PATCH: Partial updates.


#Q19>Describe the concept of statelessness in RESTful APIs?
#Ans.In a stateless system, each client request to the server must contain all the necessary information for the server to understand and process the request. The server does not store any information about the client's state between requests.



#Q20>What is the significance of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) in RESTful API design?
#Ans>.


#Q21>Explain the role of hypermedia in RESTful APIs. How does it relate to HATEOAS?

#Q22>What are the benefits of using RESTful APIs over other architectural styles?
#Ans>.Simplicity and scalability.
#Lightweight and efficient.
#Widely adopted standards.
#Flexible data formats (JSON, XML).


#Q23>Discuss the concept of resource representations in RESTful APIs?
#Ans>.Data can be represented in JSON, XML, etc., allowing different views of the same resource.


#Q24>How does REST handle communication between clients and servers?
#Ans>Stateless communication via HTTP.
#Clients send requests; servers send responses.


#Q25> What are the common data formats used in RESTful API communication?
#Ans>.HTML,JSON,XML


#Q26>Explain the importance of status codes in RESTful API responses?
#Ans..Privide feedback about the result of the request.

#Q27>Describe the process of versioning in RESTful API development?
#Ans.
#Q28> How can you ensure security in RESTful API development? 
#Ans>.Use OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access.
#Implement HTTPS for data encryption.
#Validate inputs to prevent injection attacks.


#Q29>What are some best practices for documenting RESTful APIs?
#Ans>.use open Api,Include clear descrition,Authecition and authorization,versioning,constan formating.

#Q30>What considerations should be made for error handling in RESTful APIs?
#Ans>.Meaningful error messeges,standerized status codes,consistent error structure.


#31> What is SOAP, and how does it differ from REST?
#Ans>.SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):
#A protocol for exchanging structured information between applications over the web.

#Q32>Describe the structure of a SOAP message?
#Ans>.
#Envelope: The root element that defines the XML message.
#Header: Optional element for metadata (e.g., authentication).
##Fault: Optional element for error handling.

#Q33> How does SOAP handle communication between clients and servers?
#Ans>.XML based messaging, transport protocol,statefullness,security.



#Q34>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using SOAP-based web services?
#Ans>.Advantages:
#Strong Standards: Ensures consistency with protocols like WS-Security and WS-ReliableMessaging.
#Language and Platform Agnostic: Compatible with different languages and platforms.
#Stateful Operations: Supports maintaining state.
#Disadvantatages
###Complexity: More difficult to implement and maintain.
#Performance Overhead: XML parsing can slow down performance.
#Less Flexibility: Limited to XML format.
#Verbosity: Messages are larger due to XML format.



#Q35> How does SOAP ensure security in web service communication?
#Ans>.WS_ Security,Encryption,Authencication,Integirity,Transport level security.



#Q36> What is Flask, and what makes it different from other web frameworks?
#Ans>.it is micro web framework for python
#Difference
#Minimalistics,Extensible,easy to learn,


#Q37>Describe the basic structure of a Flask application.
#Ans>.from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)



#Q38>How do you install Flask on your local machine?

pip install Flask


#Q39>Explain the concept of routing in Flask.

def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

#Q40> What are Flask templates, and how are they used in web development?
